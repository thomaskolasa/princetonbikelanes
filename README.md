# Build Separated Bike Lanes for All Levels of Cyclists

Urban planner and designer Mikael Colville-Andersen shows what cycling means in Copenhagen, and what we need throughout Princeton:

Transport accounted for 30% of community greenhouse gas emissions, and the majority came from cars<sup>1</sup>. While 62% of Copenhageners bike to work, only 5% of Princetonians do<sup>2</sup>.


The current Bicycle Mobility Plan recommends "Bicycle Boulevards" along roads like Prospect Ave, forcing cars and bikes to dangerously share the road instead of building separated raised bike lanes. Shared lane markings, or *sharrows*, are not a solution for common riders.

Drivers don't like it either. Common bike traffic in bicycle lanes makes the Netherlands [the best country to be a driver in the world according to Waze](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/best-place-in-the-world-to-be-a-driver-netherlands).
