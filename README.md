# Build Separated Bike Lanes for All Levels of Cyclists

Urban planner and designer Mikael Colville-Andersen shows what cycling means in Copenhagen, and what we need throughout Princeton:

{% include youtube.html id="RJGIhu02ATg" %}

Transport accounted for 30% of community greenhouse gas emissions, and the majority came from cars<sup>1</sup>. While 62% of Copenhageners bike to work, only 5% of Princetonians do<sup>2</sup>. Copenhageners regularly take 30 minute trips, while the majority of Princeton residents could bike to town in 15 minutes. They don't because of missing infrastructure.


The current Bicycle Mobility Plan recommends "Bicycle Boulevards" along roads like Prospect Ave, forcing cars and bikes to dangerously share the road instead of building separated raised bike lanes. Shared lane markings, or *sharrows*, are not a solution for common riders.

Drivers don't like it either. Casual bicycle traffic in bike lanes makes the Netherlands [the best country to be a driver in the world according to Waze](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/best-place-in-the-world-to-be-a-driver-netherlands).

### Examples of modern ways to make Princeton safe:

1. Nassau St:
   * We need a protected bike lane going west. This doesn't require anything besides fresh paint from Moore St to Baryard Ln.
   * Likewise going east. This only needs fresh paint from University Pl to Charlton St.
2. High School, Middle School, and Chior College area:
   * Moore St, Walnut Ln, and Franklin Ave need raised separated bike lanes to protect students during their commutes.
3. Prospect Ave:
   * This wide street and cycling artery should have separated bike lanes going both directions.
   * They should be between parked cars and the sidewalk, offering the most protection and least stress.
4. Paul Robeson Pl from 206 to Chambers St:
   * There is space on both sides for raised bike lanes where cyclists would be protected by small curbs. If we only build it one way, that's a good start!
   * These can then be extended onto Hodge Rd.
5. Route 206 from Bayard Ln to Edgerstoune Rd:
   * There is space for raised bike lanes in both directions along the road.
6. Elm Rd:
   * The bike lanes do not offer protection. The northbound bike lane should be raised, meaning the curb should have been extended to the edge of the bike lane.
   * The south bound bike lane should also be raised to offer actual protection.
7. Rosedale Rd roundabout:
   * After so much hard work, the community *completely* forgot that a bike path runs along the road. There needs to be a separate bike crossing next to the pedestrian crossing of General Johnson Rd. While the roundabout calms traffic without stopping it, the pedestrian crossing causes cyclists to nearly come to a complete stop before fighting pedestrians for space.
